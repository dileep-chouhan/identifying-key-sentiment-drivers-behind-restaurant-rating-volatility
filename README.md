# Identifying Key Sentiment Drivers Behind Restaurant Rating Volatility

**Overview:**

This project analyzes restaurant reviews to identify the key aspects of service and food quality that most significantly correlate with changes in customer ratings over time.  By pinpointing these sentiment drivers, restaurants can focus their improvement efforts on areas with the greatest impact on customer satisfaction and rating volatility. The analysis utilizes natural language processing techniques to extract sentiment and key topics from reviews, linking them to observed rating fluctuations.

**Technologies Used:**

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* NLTK (or spaCy, if used)  
* scikit-learn (if used for any machine learning)


**How to Run:**

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Make sure you have Python installed. Then, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and install the required Python libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Analysis:** Execute the main script using:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   Ensure that the necessary data files (e.g., review data, rating data) are in the correct location as specified in the code.


**Example Output:**

The script will print key findings to the console, including correlations between specific sentiment aspects (e.g., "service speed," "food quality," "ambience") and rating volatility.  Additionally, the analysis will generate visualizations such as:

* Scatter plots showing the relationship between specific sentiment scores and rating changes.
* Bar charts illustrating the relative importance of different sentiment drivers.
* (Other relevant plots as generated by the analysis).

These plots will be saved as image files (e.g., `sentiment_correlation.png`, `sentiment_importance.png`) in the project's output directory.  The exact output files and their names may vary depending on the analysis performed.  Refer to the code for specifics.
